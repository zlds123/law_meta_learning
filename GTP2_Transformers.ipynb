       "user >> Not entirely, Mr. Chief Justice, for this reason: It does involve differential systems, unequal access, but regardless of whether or not that unequal access is racially motivated, you would not have to prove that the intent behind the differential access provided to minorities was to suppress or hinder the minority vote. And that's a key distinction from Mobile versus Bolden.                             \n",
       "bot >> I'm not sure what you're getting at. \n",
       "user >> Well, Justice Thomas, I think it speaks precisely in those terms. It says that a voting practice cannot result in minorities having less opportunity than non-minorities. It says the system needs to be equally open. So what it's saying is as long as everyone has the same opportunity and the system is equally open, Section 2 does not condemn it. The Respondents, however, would say that even if minorities are given precisely the same opportunity, unless they utilize it proportionally, then somehow that comes within the constraints of Section 2. But, again, there's nothing in the text of Section 2 which says you need to expand time, place, and manner restrictions to enhance proportionality or maximization. Indeed, if that had been the rule, in 1982, virtually every time, place, and manner restriction in the country would have been illegal overnight because there was severe disproportionate utilization and socioeconomic disparities were ubiquitous. And surely, if Congress had intended that kind of sea change, it would have given some hint of it in the legislative history. So this rule is both contrary to the text of Section 2 and any other formulation of what Congress was intending.                          \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> Only in the sense that result, obviously, connotes causation, right? And the question is: what is the prohibited -- what can you not cause? What is the prohibited result? And the plain language of Section 2 tells you what the system can't result in is providing less opportunity to minorities. It doesn't say it can't result in providing them the same opportunity, but, for whatever reason, they don't utilize it to the same extent. So there is a causation question, but the question is what can the state not cause. We say it can't cause less opportunity. The other side says it can't do anything that results in disproportionate outcomes.                            \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> Well, again, it depends what you're talking about, Justice Thomas. If you're talking about disproportionate outcomes, we don't think that's the issue. So we don't think a severely disproportionate outcome jeopardizes Section 2 viability, nor does a minor disproportionate outcome. The question is not the outcome. The question is the opportunity and if the state has provided everyone the same opportunity. Now I will agree with the attorney general, however, if you get past that, then, obviously, there needs to be something substantial for two reasons. No one requires perfect, of course --                          \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> Yeah. I mean, I think there may be an argument that he is. I think that's a different case. It would depend on the actual facts of the job duties. I -- I think, in this case, whether it was deputy U.S. Marshal, U.S. Marshal, or when he was a deputy sheriff, pages JA 176 and 177 show that Mr. Dawson had the same job duties. The State's never contested that. And, indeed, as a U.S. Marshal, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Dawson testified at those pages that there were two critical similarities among others. One was that he was entrusted to enforce West Virginia law as a U.S. Marshal. And the second was that, for fugitive task forces, he could deputize the very same state troopers and deputy sheriffs who are exempted under the West Virginia plan. So --                        \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> Yes. Well, two points. One is, of course, there's nothing in the language of Section 2 which allows you to justify a discriminatory result based on the strength of --                             \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> I -- I think what they mean is what the Court meant in Crawford, which is what we all understand to be the usual burdens of voting. You make a very good point about 1982. We know that needs to be the benchmark for the usual burdens because, otherwise, that meant Congress in 1982 was invalidating virtually every time, place, and manner restriction. So that needs to be, if you will, the safe harbor. The only point we're making is Section 2 did not immunize minorities from the usual burdens of voting. It didn't say, you -- you don't have to show up at the right precinct and those sorts of things. And there's nothing in the language of Section 2 which somehow exempts them from doing so. So, as long as it's roughly commensurate with the normal Election Day system that exists, that would constitute the usual burden of voting.                           \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> Your Honor, I would love it if the state could justify its systems if you're going to impose on them some kind of proportionality mandate. Our basic point is it's not a proportionality mandate and their justification should not be an affirmative defense to that. If you want to read that into the statute, that would make it better than a straight proportionality mandate. I will emphasize again that even under Houston Lawyers' Association, which the Solicitor General puts forward, the justification is merely one factor out of the nine to be considered. So that means you're now into this amorphous nine Senate report factors where every district court and appellate court can do its own kind of balancing test, which will lead to all sorts of ad hoc results and not give you the kind of clarity and guidance that state legislatures need prior to Election Day.                           \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> But you have some parts of it wrong. So two things. Number one, that was a study of a single river and it was a study of all barriers on that river, not state culverts.                             \n",
       "bot >>  \n",
       "user >> In two places. One is we -- it's not a denial at a time, place, and manner, so it needs --                             \n",
