W.P.No.15244 of 2004 has been filed praying for  the  issue  of  aWrit  of  Certiorarified  Mandamus  to quash the Consent Order dated 16.8.2002issued by the first respondent/Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in favour ofthe 2nd respondent/The  Perundari  Leather  Industries  Eco  Security  PrivateLimited (hereinafter called \\x11PLIES\\x12).5.  W.P.No.    1682 of 2003 has been filed praying that no tanneries should beset up in and around Perundurai, as it would  cause  damage  to  the  drinkingwater, as well as water used for agriculture purposes.6.  The  petitioner  in  W.P.No.  15244 of 2004 claims to be a Welfare Societyregistered under Section 10 of the  Tamil  Nadu  Societies  Registration  Act,1975.   It is alleged in paragraph-3 of the affidavit filed in support of thispetition that there are about 800 tanneries situated in  the  State  of  TamilNadu,  of  which  about 550 are in Vellore district, 100 in Dindigul district,150 located in Pammal and Pallavaram and 50 tanneries in  Erode  and  some  inTrichy District.   It is alleged that these tanneries let out effluents, whichcontain Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) not less than 10000 to 15000 mg/1  litre.The outer limit fixed for discharge of TDS is only 2100 mg/per 1 litre for thetanneries.7.  The  Supreme  Court in VELLORE CITIZENS\\x12 WELFARE FORUM Vs.  UNION OF INDIA          (1996) 5 SCC 647 gave several directions relating to tanneries in the State ofTamil Nadu.

The  quality  of  ambient waters has to be maintained through thestandards stipulated by the Board.        8.  In Paragraph 26 of  the  aforesaid  judgment,  the  Supreme  Courtobserved  that  the Madras High Court would be in a better position to monitorthe above directions, and hence, the Chief Justice of the  Madras  High  Courtwas  requested to constitute a special \\x13Green Bench\\x14 to deal with the case andother environmental matters.  The High Court was requested to treat the matteras a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and gave  libertyto the  parties  to approach the High Court as and when necessary.  As per thedirections of the Honourable Supreme Court  in  the  aforesaid  decision,  theChief  Justice  of Madras High Court nominated Hon\\x12ble Mr.Justice P.Bhaskaran,as the Chairman of the authority constituted under  direction  no.(1)  of  theorder of the Supreme Court mentioned above.         9.   The  Honourable  Mr.Justice P.Bhaskaran on 12.10.99 visited Erodeand SIPCOT Industrial Estate, Perundurai and recommended that all tanneries inErode must be shifted to State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil  NaduLimited  (in  short  \\x11SIPCOT\\x12), Perundurai in order to reduce pollution in theriver Cauvery and Kalingarayan Canal, the main sources of drinking  water  andirrigation of Erode Distirct.        10.   It  may be mentioned that Tamil Nadu Co-operation for IndustrialInfrastructure Development (in short \\x11TACID\\x12) have put up an Industrial GrowthCentre at Perundurai and Engur villages, Perundurai Taluk, Erode  District  byacquiring 2800  acres of lands.  Subsequently, in the year 1999 the PerunduraiIndustrial Growth Centre was merged with SIPCOT.  Since the entire  extent  of2800 acres of land had not been utilized for the purpose for which it has beenacquired,  the  TACID  approached  the  1st  respondent with a request to giveconsent to establish a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (in  short  \\x11CETP\\x12)  toenable the tanneries at Erode to relocate their units to SIPCOT complex.        11.    On  17.03.2001,  the  District  Environmental  Engineer  issuedinstructions to form a CETP and asked Erode tanners  to  shift  their  tanningactivities to  SIPCOT  Complex,  Perundurai.    On  28.04.2001,  the  DistrictCollector wrote a detailed D.O.  letter on the present status of river Cauveryand Kalingarayan canal and strongly recommended for the shifting of  tanneriesin Erode  to  SIPCOT  Complex,  Perundurai  for curtailing the pollution.  TheDistrict Collector, Erode requested the SIPCOT  Industrial  Growth  Centre  toallot lands  for  the  tanneries.  Thereafter, Erode District Small IndustriesAssociation, informed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board about  the  stepstaken  by them to set up a tannery complex at SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre,Perundurai.  About 50 tanneries in and around Erode Town have  been  asked  torelocate their units at SIPCOT Complex, Perundurai.        12.   The  petitioner in the present writ petition had also filed WritPetition No.  1682 of 2003 praying for the relief of Mandamus  forbearing  therespondents  from permitting any polluting industries, particularly tanneries,either old or new, to be established  in  and  around  Perundurai.    In  thatpetition, the Division Bench of this Court on 24.01 .2004 passed the followingorder:-\\x13 Notice  to respondents 1 and 2.  Pollution Control Board not to give consentfor establishment of any new tannery pending further orders\\x14        13.  It is alleged in paragraph-7 of the affidavit filed in support ofthe petition that despite the communication  of  the  above  said  order,  thesecond respondent/PLIES has proceeded with the construction of tanneries.  Thepetitioner  came to know that the consent was issued prior to the order of theDivision Bench in W.P.No.1682 of 2003, and hence by this  petition  they  havechallenged the consent order dated 16 .08.2002 issued by the first respondent/Tamil  Nadu  Pollution Control Board in favour of the second respondent/PLIES.It is submitted that Section 25(3) of the Water  (Prevention  and  Control  ofPollution) Act, 1974 has been violated, as the enquiry before granting consentwas not  held.    It  is  also  submitted  that  as per the Environment ImpactAssessment  Notification  S.O.60  (E)  Dated  27.1.2004  prior   environmentalclearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India hasnot been  obtained.    It  is  alleged that setting up of tanneries will causedamage to the agriculturists living in that area, as  the  main  water  sourcewill be  polluted.  It is alleged that the \\x13 Precautionary Principle\\x14 has beenviolated.  It is also alleged that permitting polluting industries in the areawill have adverse affect on the patients and  will  aggravate  the  infectiousdiseases.14.  It is alleged in paragraph-4 (j) of the affidavit filed in support of thewrit  petition  that  the  respondents  are  planning  to  permit tanneries inPerundurai, which is land locked for almost 25 kms.  radius and  they  do  nothave any  perennial  river.  It is alleged that the \\x13 Precautionary Principle\\x14is being violated by permitting polluting industries to  be  set  up  in  thatarea.   It  is  alleged  that  if  tanneries  are  allowed to be set up there,effluents that would be discharged by the tanneries will  pollute  the  groundwater.  The petitioner, therefore, prays that no tanneries should be set up inand around Perundurai, as it would cause damage to the drinking water, as wellas water used for agriculture purposes.        15.    In   the  counter  affidavit  filed  on  behalf  of  the  firstrespondent/Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in W.P.No.15244 of 2004, it  hasbeen  clarified  that whereas in its interim order in Writ Petition (C) No.914of 1991 ( Vellore Citizens\\x12 Welfare Forum Vs.  Union of India and others), theSupreme Court had prohibited setting up of tanneries in  the  State  of  TamilNadu,  subsequently,  in  its  final  judgment,  there  is  no  such  absoluteprohibition.  What is stated in direction no.10 contained in the  judgment  isthis:-10.  Government  Order  No.    213  dated  March  30,  1989  shall be enforcedforthwith.  No new industry listed in Annexure I to the notification shall  bepermitted to be set up within the prohibited area.  The authority shall reviewthe  cases of all the industries which are already operating in the prohibitedarea and it would be open to the authority to direct the relocation of any  ofsuch industries\\x14.What is now prohibited is setting up of new industries listed in Annexure-I tothe Notification dated 30.3.89 in the prohibited area only.        16.   The definition of \\x13Prohibited Area\\x14, as contained in G.O.Ms.No.213, Environment and Forests (EC-I) dated 30th March 1989, reads:-\\x13 In the Government Order first read above, the Government have ordered, amongother things, that no industry  causing  serious  water  pollution  should  bepermitted  within  one kilometer from the embankments of rivers, streams, damsetc., and that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board should furnish a list ofsuch industries to all local bodies.    It  has  been  suggested  that  it  isnecessary  to  have  a  sharper definition for water sources so that ephemeralwater collections like rain water  ponds,  drains,  sewerages  (biodegradable)etc., may  be  excluded  from  the  purview of the above order.  The Chairman,Tamil Nadu  Pollution  Control  Board,  has  stated  that  the  scope  of  theGovernment  Order  may be restricted to reservoirs, rivers and public drinkingwater sources.  He has also stated that there should  be  a  complete  ban  onlocation  of  highly  polluting industries within 1 kilometer of certain watersources.2.  The Government  have  carefully  examined  the  above  suggestions.    TheGovernment  impose  a  total  ban  on  the  setting up of the highly pollutingindustries mentioned in Annexure-I to this order within one kilometer from theembankments of the water sources mentioned in Annexure II to this order.3.  The Government also direct that  under  any  circumstance  if  any  highlypolluting  industry  is  proposed  to  be set up within one kilometer from theembankments of water sources other than those mentioned in Annexure_II to thisorder, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board  should  examine  the  case  andobtain the approval of the Government for it\\x14        Thus,  the  \\x13Prohibited Area\\x14 is an area within one kilometer from theembankments of rivers, streams, dams etc.   There  is  nothing  to  show  thatPerundurai  comes  within  the  \\x13Prohibited  Area\\x14,  rather  it is admitted inparagraph-4 (l)  of  the  affidavit  of  the  petitioner  that  they  are  notquestioning  the  competence  of  the  respondents  of  permitting  to  set uptanneries in Perundurai.        17.  The apprehension of the petitioner is that if tanneries  are  setup  in  Perundurai  the  ground water will get polluted and the agriculturistswould not be able to use the land for cultivation due to pollution.        18.  Counter affidavit has been filed in W.P.No.1682 of  2003  by  theJoint  Chief  Environmental  Engineer,  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control Board,Chennai.  Paragraphs 6 to 9 of this counter affidavit states as follows:-\\x13 It is respectfully submitted that the Tamil Nadu Corporation for  IndustrialInfrastructure  Development  (TACID),  a  Government of Tamil Nadu enterpriseshave put up an Industrial  Growth  Centre  at  Perundurai  &  Ingur  Villages,Perundurai  Taluk,  Erode  District by acquiring 1133 hectares (2800 acres) ofland.  This industrial growth center has been planned to  accommodate  varioustypes of  industries  such  as  textile dyeing, tanneries, chemicals etc.  TheTACID applied to Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board on 2.4.1996  and  obtainedconsent  to  establish  Water  and  Air Acts from Tamil Nadu Pollution ControlBoard on 18.8.97.  Subseqsuently, during 1999, the said Perundurai  IndustrialGrowth  Centre  has  been merged with SIPCOT, Tamil Nadu which is now known as   SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre (SIGC). It is respectfully submitted that the District Collector, Erode  District  hasaddressed  the  Chairman  &  Managing  Director, SIPCOT, Chennai in his letterdt.24.3.2001 to  allot  land  in  the  SIGC,  Perundurai  for  the  tanneries.EEDISSIA  (Erode District Small Industries Association) had informed the Boardin their letter dated 19.10.2001 about the initiatives taken by them to put upa tannery complex at SIGC, Perundurai. It is further submitted that  25  proposed  tanneries  have  come  forward  toestablish   the   tanneries  in  SIGC  and  formed  a  CETP  company  by  nameM/s.Perundurai Leather Industries Eco-Security Private Ltd (PLIES) and appliedfor the consent of the Board under Water and Air Acts on 06 .05.2002 to put upa CETP to treat  a  2500  KLD  of  trade  effluent  arising  from  the  membertanneries.   As  per  the precautionary principle, the Board has advocated fortwo stage treatment system to address the  wastewater  problem  posed  by  thetanneries.Stage No.1 :  The physio-chemical, biological treatment system.Stasge No.II:   To propose a system to address the problem of containing totaldissolved solids and ensuring zero dischargeThe CETP company has been furnished the proposals  for  Stage  I  prepared  byCLRI, a  pioneer  research  institute  exclusively for leather industries.  Itaddresses the solution for biological parameters such  as  Biochemical  oxygendemand  and  Chemical oxygen demand etc., The proposals pertaining to Stage II could ensure Zero discharge of effluent.  Based on the above, Board has issuedconsent to  establish  to  the  CETP  company  on  16.8.2002  considering  the\\x11precautionary principle\\x12 with certain conditions stressing the implementationof  treatment  systems  as  per stage I & II before commissioning of the CETP,which treat the trade effluent arising from 25 member tanneries of  the  CETP.On  implementation  of  consent order conditions, it could be ensured that thereuse of treated effluent zero discharge from the CETP.It is respectfully submitted that TACID and  latter  SIGC  have  developed  anindustrial  complex  to accommodate the dyeing industries, tannery industries,chemical industries etc., in Perundurai & Ingur  Villages,  Perundurai  Taluk,Erode District.    It  is  an  industrial  complex  and  located away from theprohibited area as contemplated in G.O.Ms.No.213 , E & F Dept., dt.30.3.89 andG.O.Ms.No.127, E&F Dept., dt.8.5.98.  These G.Os  prohibit  14  categories  ofindustries such as tanneries, textile dyeing units etc., located within one kmand five   km  respectively  from  specified  water  sources.    Further,  theimplementation of stage I & II by the CETP ensure that the TDS  of  2100  mg/lspecified by the Board shall be achievable and treated trade effluent shall becompletely  reused  by  the  member  tanneries  by  installing R.O system withsuitable evaporation system for the rejects so as  to  ensure  Zero  dischargefrom the  CETP.  Under the circumstances, the Board has taken action to comply with the orders of the Hon\\x12ble Supreme Court of  India  dt.28.8.96  issued  inW.P(civil) No.914/91.   Thus,  the  TDS  problem  can  be  solved.   Moreover,incorporating  the  above  precautionary  principles,  the  consent  order  toestablish to the CETP was issued with appropriate conditions to the above CETPat SIGC,  Perundurai  on 16.8.2002.  On implementation of the treatment systemas per the conditions imposed, the apprehension of the  petitioner  about  theTDS problem  will  be  resolved.    The  CLRI, Chennai and Council for LeatherExports have involved to assist technically and financially in  implementationof the CETP, M/ s.Perundurai Industries Eco Security Pvt.Ltd, SIGC, Perunduraiupto Stage-I.    The  CETP  system proposed at SIGC, Perundurai is a candidatetechnology and also based on best available technology (BAT) system\\x14.It is evident from the above that SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre, Perundurai,Erode District  is  not  within  the  \\x13Prohibited  Area\\x14  as  contemplated  inG.O.Ms.No.213,  E&F Dept., dt.30.3.89 and G.O.Ms.No.127, E&F Dept., dt.8.5.98.  Hence, in our opinion, there can be no bar to setting  up  tanneries  in  thatarea.        19.   It  is also evident from the facts of the case that in May 2002,the Technical and  Advisory  Consultant,  Central  Leather  Research  Instiute(CLRI), a Government of India undertaking, submitted a detailed project reportbefore  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control  Board  for the construction of CommonEffluent Treatment Plant on behalf of PLIES.  On 16.08.2002,  the  Tamil  NaduPollution Control Board issued consent to PLIES for construction of the CommonEffluent  Treatment  Plant  with zero discharge concept based on the report ofthe Central Leather Research  Institute.    On  25.10.2002,  the  Council  forLeather Exports under the Ministry of Industries and Commerce was appointed as the  Implementing Agency of the project and the Government of India sanctionedRs.294 lakhs as grant for the construction  of  a  Common  Effluent  TreatmentPlant at  Perundurai  through Council for Leather Exports.  On 18.12.2002, theTamil Nadu Pollution Control Board issued noticed to all 44 tanneries situatedat Erode to shift to SIPCOT, Perundurai within 3 months.  On  27.01.2003,  theCentral  Leather  Research  Institute  released  posters  to  relocate all thetanneries at Erode to SIPCOT, Perundurai.  We are informed  that  the  overallconstruction  of  Effluent  Treatment  Plant has been practically completed atPerundurai.        20.  It may be mentioned that consent under Section 25  of  The  Water(Prevention  and  Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 was given on 16.08.200 2 andthe said order is appelable under Section 28.   However,  without  filing  anyappeal  and  exhausting the alternative remedy, writ petition No.15244 of 2004has been  filed  on  31.05.2004  challenging  the  consent  order  granted  on16.08.2002 i.e.,  after  a lapse of 19 months.  In our opinion, on this groundalone, the  writ  petition  should  have  been  dismissed.    Public  InterestLitigation is often misused now days, and such petitions are being filed oftenwith ulterior  motive.    However, we need not elaborate on this aspect, as weare of the opinion that there are absolutely no merits in this petition.        21.  On 12.10.1999, Loss of Ecology (P&PC) Chairman headed by Hon\\x12 bleMr.Justice P.Bhaskaran visited the tanneries  situated  in  Erode,  which  arepolluting  river Cauvery and Kalingarayan canal, and directed the tanneries tobe shifted to SIPCOT, Perundurai.  The Pollution Control Board has also issuednotices to all tanneries in Erode to shift to SIPCOT, Perundurai.   The  StateIndustries  Promotion  Corporation  of Tamil Nadu Limited (SIPCOT), which is aGovernment of Tamil Nadu undertaking, had  acquired  2500  acres  of  land  inPerundurai,  which  is  far  away  from  the water sources, for the purpose ofIndustrial Growth Centre for locating the industries declared  as  capable  ofhighly polluting  the  environment.    In this center, an area of 106 acres ofland has been allotted to the tannery zone.  About  25  tanneries,  which  hadwanted to shift to Perundurai, formed a company to establish a Common EffluentTreatment  Plant, and approached the Central Leather Research Institute, whichgave a detailed project report on the basis of  which  the  Pollution  ControlBoard granted  consent  on  16.08.2002.    As  per  the project report and theconditions of consent there is no  discharge  of  effluent  in  land  and  theprocess involves \\x11zero discharge\\x12.        22.   The  total cost of construction of the Common Effluent TreatmentPlant was Rs.7 crores, out of which the second respondent (PLIES) has investedRs.4.06 crores and the Government of India has sanctioned Rs.2.94 crores.  Theproject is being monitored by a wing of  the  Ministry  of  Industries  namelyCouncil for  Leather  Exports.   It is alleged that the construction of CommonEffluent Treatment Plant is almost complete.    The  photographs  showing  thestage of the construction is enclosed as an annexure.        23.   In  our opinion, the writ petition is an abuse of process of theCourt.  The Common Effluent Treatment Plant will be used by 25  tanneries  andthey  will  let  out  effluents to this Common Effluent Treatment Plant, whichwill be treated and  recycled  with  zero  discharge.    We  cannot  see  whatobjection any one can have to this.24.   The factual position has been set out in great detail in paragraphs 6 to9 of the counter-affidavit of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Pollution  Control  Board  inW.P.No.  1682  of  2003, which we have quoted in entirety above.  A perusal ofthese factual averments clearly show that the authorities  have  ensured  thatthere  will  be  no  pollution  in  Perundurai, because of the Common EffluentTreatment  Plant,  and  the  apprehension  of   the   petitioner   is   whollymisconceived. 25.   As  already  stated  above,  these days \\x13public interest litigation\\x14 hasbecome largely \\x13private interest  litigation\\x14  for  ulterior  motives,  or  ismisused by business rivals, or persons who sponsor such litigation from behindwith mala fide intentions.  We cannot appreciate these tactics.  The docket ofthe Court  is  already overful with arrears.  The Court should discourage thiskind of motivated litigation, which only adds to its burden.26.  In a very recent decision of the Supreme Court in Special Leave  Petition(Civil) No.26269  of 2004 (Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware Vs.  State of Maharashtra)dated 14.12.2004, it has come down very heavily on public interest litigation,which is filed with ulterior motive eg., black mailing.  The Supreme Court  inthat decision observed:-\\x13  Public  Interest Litigation which has now come to occupy an important fieldin the administration of law should not be \\x13publicity interest litigation\\x14  or\\x13Private  interest litigation\\x14 or \\x13politics interest litigation\\x14 or the latesttrend \\x13paise income litigation\\x14.  The High Court has found that  the  case  athand belongs  to  the  last  category.    If  not properly regulated and abuseaverted, it becomes also a tool in unscrupulous hands to release vendetta  andwreck vengeance,  as  well.    There  must be real and genuine public interestinvolved in the litigation and not merely an adventure of knight errant  borneout of  wishful  thinking.  It cannot also be invoked by a person or a body ofpersons to further his or their  personal  causes  or  satisfy  his  or  theirpersonal rudge  and  enmity.    Courts  of justice should not be allowed to bepolluted  by  unscrupulous  litigants  by  resorting  to   the   extraordinaryjurisdiction.  A person acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in theproceeding  of  public  interest litigation will alone have a locus standi andcan approach the Court to wipe out violation of fundamental rights and genuineinfraction of statutory provisions, but  not  for  personal  gain  or  privateprofit or  political  motive or any oblique consideration.  These aspects werehighlighted by this Court in The Janata Dal Vs.  H.S.Chowdhary  1992  (4)  SCC305 and  Kazi Lhendup Dorji Vs.  Central Bureau of Investigation 1994 Supp (2)SCC 116.  A writ petitioner who comes  to  the  Court  for  relief  in  publicinterest  must  come  not only with clean hands like any other writ petitionerbut also with a clean heart,  clean  mind  and  clean  objective  (See  RamjasFoundation Vs.    Union  of  India,  AIR  1993  SC  852  and  K.R.Srinivas Vs.R.M.Premchand, 1994 (6) SCC 620.'"
